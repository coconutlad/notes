# Practice
How to get started and get better at something. This is what I understood from these articles about [deliberate practice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-deliberate-practice-to-learn-programming-fast/) and [consistency for coders](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-be-more-consistent-when-learning-to-code/). I feel that it's not just the time you spend practising but also how you practice that determines your growth. Article 1 agrees with that statement. Anyways, here we go:  

One definition of "deliberate practice" that I found online and seemed to make sense is "Practice that requires effort and is done with the goal of improving performance". So what do you need to do that?
* A goal. It can also help provide motivation. Then you must describe a path to that goal from where you are now. Split that path into small, measurable steps. One nice way to do this to **collect many paths described by experts, pick out steps that interest you** (important!) and make your own path.
* Slowly push yourself out of your comfort zone. This is so that you can actually make progress and adapt. You should keep looking out for things which are **just harder than what you usually do**.
* Focus. Put your 100% into what you're doing. If not anything else it's **efficient**. Eliminate internal and external distractions in this world which constantly tries to steal our attention.
* Actually doing things. Watching tutorials and reading articles gives a false sense of accomplishment and progress. It is easy and since you don't put effort into it you don't actually get better. It also means that you may not be able to actually implement the concept when required. Implement what you learn, get through the challenges you face when you're doing it. **You will gain a deeper and clearer understanding of the concept**. You can do it once while following a guide but you must also do it once all by yourself. Do it twice so you can see it wasn't a fluke.
* Know how you're progressing. Get feedback on your attempts. You can do it by yourself by comparing your work with the "true" work or you could have an expert assess it. Either way, this can help you stay on the path without deviating and ending up in an undesirable state.
* Once you know how far you are off the path you want, get back. Adjust your practice, re-learn concepts which you misunderstood and make the changes you got from the previous point. **This will make sure that your effort is useful.**  

To apply those concepts and get positive results from them you need to do them consistently. That's how you build a habit and make the process of practising easier. It takes time.  
The truth is that most important things take effort and time to accomplish. To finish the task and to benefit from it, a reliable way is to do it in parts but to do it consistently overall.

## Behaviours
How do you consistently do something? By altering your behaviour (that's one way). How do you know if a behaviour can be incorporated into your life (in simple terms, will you actually do it?)? The Fogg Behaviour Models provides a formula: "**Behaviour = Motivation * Ability * Prompt**". A prompt can succeed only when "Motivation * Ability" is high enough.

Motivation is unreliable (even internal sometimes). Assume the worst case and plan with the assumption that your motivation will be low. Consistency is important. Start with **a small task that you can always do**. On some days you may be able to do more but you must always do the small task at least.

Other than motivation and ability, a prompt and a reward are also required to form a successful habit. Rewards are a positive reinforcement hack to get your brain into liking the behaviour. Rewards work best when they are immediate and positive.

In the end, it isn't magic. It's consistency, adjusting to feedback and pushing yourself. I haven't yet followed all the advice from this. I hope to apply these concepts and learn better :smile:.

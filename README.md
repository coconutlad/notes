# notes
Learning how things work.

For future reference, since my memory is as good as that of a floppy disk being waved around a neodymium magnet.  
I hope this isn't illegal.

How to make notes: Do stuff first (includes reading / watching videos). Finish it and then start writing. This forces you to recall and hopefully strengthens your memory of whatever you're writing about.

# An opinionated set of tools & stuff
There are a lot of ways to do things. Choosing between them can waste your time.
You get distracted from what you really want to do.
These are the things I use when I want to get stuff done.
If you learn to use these **well** you'll find that they can do everything that you need (In most cases).
For things that aren't mentioned, the defaults probably work just fine or I haven't added it yet.

* Text editor : [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Text editor for your terminal (when you can't use VS Code Remote for some reason): Vim or Nano ([Micro is a good alternative](https://micro-editor.github.io/))
* Theme : VS Code dark+ or One Dark (which also has One Light)
* Terminal shell : Powershell + oh-my-posh for Windows. Bash / zsh + oh-my-posh for Linux
* Scripting & Automation : Python (it's probably already on your system) + venv for virtual env stuff. Check out the Jupyter notebook integration with VS Code.
* Font : Hack for code. Consolas for most other things. [Meslolgs Nerd Font](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font) for your terminal or Ubuntu Mono in case you don't want those fancy powerline symbols.
* Plugin manager for vim : [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* Word document editor : [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) (Google slides for presentations and sheets for excel stuff).
* PDF Viewer : Your browser (MS Edge has some nice additional tools)
* Hosting static content : GitHub pages. (repository settings > pages)
* Sharing editable web stuff : [Plunker](https://plnkr.co/)
